# Tailwind
### I liked using Tailwind and thought it made the development easier. The tailwind language I felt was kind of like a shortcut, easy to understand the abbreviations and just by using two letters-number it translated it into my css as a much longer code.
## I used @apply and it helped a lot first learning about scss and Mixin to be able to use it in my Tailwind.
