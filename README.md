Tailwind
I liked using Tailwind and thought it made the development easier. The tailwind language I felt was kind of like a shortcut, easy to understand the abbreviations and just by using two letters-number it translated it into my css as a much longer code.
I used @apply in my project. Learning about scss first and Mixin helped alot to be able to use @apply in my Tailwind.

My website
Step1: I started by putting everything that I wanted on my page
Step2: when I was done reading more about Tailwind on tailwindcss.com I started to get a hang of the language they used and worked my way from there.
Step3: I made 'cards' that were for my product I was selling. To have my html clean I used the @apply in my input.css.
Step4: It took some time getting the cards like I wanted them but as soon as I was done with one it was just copy paste.
Step5: Make one product active. I wrote 'CHECK ME OUT' to make it easier to see what product is linkt to a page.

Made a new html for a specific product
Step6: Page 2 has a extra 'HOME' button. I also used a 'card' to have the two pages connect. There is a image of the product and a 'BUY NOW' button. There was some important text that I made @apply 'ath' in my html and it made the text have a red border.
